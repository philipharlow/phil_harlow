# This is a simple program that implements object oriented design to simulate a pet of sort

This version implements a networking side so you can launch multiple clients and they all communicate through the server.

To run the program
  1. launch the server and choose a port number not in use by the computer.
  2. launch the client and input that same port number.
  3. repeat 2 until you are satisfied with the number of clients you have.
