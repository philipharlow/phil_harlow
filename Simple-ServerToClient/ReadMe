# I completed this program as part1 of a 3part project

The server will start first and then start the client. The client will connect to the server and the connection will remain open
until the client decides to terminate the connection. During this time anything you type into the client side will be printed out
on the server side. You can also redirect a file into the client and the server will print this out.

I worked with a partner on this and he was in charge of writing the client while I wrote the server
It was a good example of having 2 individuals in charge of different aspects of the project and understanding
how to write the program such that the 2 peieces can be put together without extra work.
