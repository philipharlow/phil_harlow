#Final project for Object-Oriented-Design, This was completed in a group of 4 with everyone having seperate responsibilites.

This was a fun project to work on and we only had 1 month to create a version of safari zone from pokemon. We used object oriented designs for this project which allows these classes to be used elsewhere.

To test the game run the pokemonController as a java application
